# PhD Degree Program

Detailed information about our PhD program, including requirements, research areas, and timelines.

## PhD in Statistics and Applied Probability

Our doctoral program in Statistics and Applied Probability prepares graduate students to expand the boundaries of statistical theory and practice for use in real-world problem solving. Graduates are trained for a career in academics or industry where they are working in and contributing to the forefront of new methods and technology. This program provides rigorous mathematical training in statistics and probability that can be used to develop real-world methodologies applicable to a wide range of interdisciplinary fields including finance, environmental science, computer science, and biomedical science. 

## Admission Requirements

Our doctoral program in Statistics and Applied Probability is open to those who hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Statistics, Mathematics, or other fields with strong quantitative requirements. Students must have a minimum overall grade point average of 3.0; one year of statistical theory that includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, best statistics and most powerful tests, regression and ANOVA concepts; and one course in linear algebra that includes vector spaces, bases in vector spaces, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.

For further admissions requirements and procedures, please visit our [admissions page](/graduate/admissions).

## Normative Time to Degree

The normative time to advancement to candidacy is 3 years. The normative time for completion of the PhD program is 5 years. Students are expected to have their core courses completed and written qualifying exams passed within the first 2 years.

## Registration Expectations

In addition to department requirements, every UC Santa Barbara graduate student is required to follow University policy with regards to degree requirements and registration expectations. You can read over these requirements on the Graduate Division website: here.

## Sample Study-Plan

Every full-time student at UC Santa Barbara is required to take 8 units of coursework per quarter. Financial support is contingent on normal progress towards the degree objective.

The following would be a typical program for a well-prepared student seeking a Ph.D. objective with no optional degree emphasis.

### Sample Study-Plan: Year 1

| Fall       | Winter     | Spring     |
|------------|------------|------------|
| PSTAT 213A | PSTAT 213B | PSTAT 213C |
| PSTAT 220A | PSTAT 220B | PSTAT 220C |
| PSTAT 207A | PSTAT 207B | PSTAT 207C |
| PSTAT 501  |            |            |

## PhD Milestone Requirements

### Area Requirements & Qualifying Exams

Each PhD student must complete two of the four [area requirements](/graduate/area-requirements): mathematical statistics, probability, applied statistics, or pure mathematics. Each student may attempt each qualifying exam twice. Each student must pass two area qualifying exams at the PhD level within three years of joining the Department's graduate program, regardless of whether they have a Master's degree or not.

### Preliminary Oral Exam

Ph.D. students must take and pass the Preliminary Oral Examination given by the student's Doctoral Committee before advancing to candidacy. The purpose of this examination is to ensure that the student has gained extensive knowledge on advanced topics in the areas surrounding his/her proposed dissertation topic and engaged in sufficient preliminary reading and research on the topic. The candidate needs to convince his/her Doctoral Committee that he/she is capable of preparing an acceptable dissertation. The examination requires a satisfactory presentation by the student of his/her proposed research topic and the results of his/her preliminary reading and research on the topic.

### Advancement to Candidacy

A student is eligible to advance to candidacy when he or she has finished the required coursework, passed the qualifying examinations, passed the preliminary oral qualifying examination, and is ready to begin working on the dissertation.

There are two sets of requirements the student must meet before advancing to candidacy: requirements established by the Academic Senate, and requirements established by the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability.

#### Academic Senate Regulations

- Minimum 3.0 GPA in all upper division and graduate classes completed since admission
- A transcript free of any "incomplete grades" or "no grades"
- Registration for three consecutive quarters, and registration during the quarter the student will advance.

#### Department of Statistics and Applied Probability Regulations

- Completion of all the core courses required for their degree with a minimum letter grade of "B" in each course
- Completion of two Qualifying Exams at the Ph.D. level
- Completion of the Preliminary Oral Qualifying Examination to the student's Doctoral Committee

### Dissertation

The doctoral dissertation constitutes a major and essential part of this program. Students will select a topic under the guidance of their advisor and a doctoral degree committee. Pre-research will begin as soon as possible during their second or third year of graduate study. More advanced research will continue after the student advances to candidacy (upon completion of the written and oral qualifying examinations). The dissertation must contain an original contribution to the field of statistics and applied probability that will expand the theory or methodology of the discipline, or contribute to the expansion of statistical methods used to solve critical problems in applied disciplines. The dissertation must be completed and submitted to the dissertation committee at least two weeks prior to the dissertation defense.

### Defense

Defense of the dissertation will take place before the doctoral degree committee. Pass or no pass is determined by the doctoral degree committee. The candidate for the PhD must make his or her dissertation available to all the members of the PhD committee at least two weeks in advance of the date of the defense. Students must also send the dissertation title and abstract to the graduate program advisor one week in advance to the defense. The defense is public, and will be announced to the department via email one week in advance of the defense. The question session is closed between the student and the committee.

### Filing

The last step before program completion is to file your completed and finalized dissertation with the Graduate Division. For details about the dissertation filing process, visit [Filing Your Thesis/Dissertation/DMA Document](http://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/academic/Filing-Your-Thesis-Dissertation-DMA-Document).

## PhD Course Requirements

### Required Courses (36 units total):

Students must pass all required courses with a grade of B or better.

- Statistical Theory: PSTAT 207A; 207B; 207C (4 units each)
- Introduction to Probability Theory & Stochastic Processes: PSTAT 213A; 213B; 213C (4 units each)
- Advanced Statistical Methods: PSTAT 220A; 220B; 220C (4 units each)

### Elective Courses (36 units total)

In addition to the required coursework, students must complete 36 units of elective coursework. Electives should be chosen from any graduate-level course in the department of Statistics and Applied Probability with the exception of PSTAT 263, PSTAT 500, PSTAT 501, PSTAT 502, and PSTAT 510. 12 of the 36 units may be from 500-level courses (with the exception of PSTAT 500, 501, 502, and 510). Courses outside of the department can only be accepted with prior approval from the Faculty Graduate Advisor.

## PhD Optional Emphases

The department offers three distinct optional emphases; these emphases require a formal petition process and will be added to the student's transcript if approved.

- [Financial Mathematics and Statistics](/graduate/phd/emphases/fms) (FMS)
- [Bioengineering](/graduate/phd/emphases/bioeng)
- [Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences](/graduate/phd/emphases/quantitative) (QMSS)
